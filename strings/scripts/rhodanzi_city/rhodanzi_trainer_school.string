My professor said these Pok\emon\nfossils were imported from the\lKanto region across the sea.

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_MainRoom_Librarian

I'm sorry, that isn't correct.\nRead up on Pok\emon type advantages\land come see me again, okay?

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_BasicCourse_TypeStudent_ItemInfo
Give that to your Pok\emon to\nmake their moves stronger!

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_BasicCourse_TypeStudent_QuizComplete
Good luck, trainer! Believe in\nyour Pok\emon and you'll do great.

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_AdvancedCourse_Professor
All the students here are well\nversed in CFRU features.\pI'd suggest talking with them to\nlearn about the new features\lavailable.

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_AdvancedCourse_BattleMovesStudent
You can check the effects of your\nmoves more easily in battle now!\pIf a move is super effective, it\nwill appear in [GREEN]green[BLUE], and if it's\lineffective it will appear in\l[ORANGE]yellow[BLUE].\pIf the move is bolded, it benefits\nfrom the Same Type Attack Boost,\lor STAB.\pPressing L will show you the move's\ndetails and effective power and\laccuracy.

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_AdvancedCourse_AutoRunStudent
Do you like going fast?\pYou can hold B while biking to go\nextra fast.\pIf you're on foot, you can press L\nto turn on auto-run.\pIt won't work if you have the L=A\nsetting turned on though[.]

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_AdvancedCourse_PokemonTypeStudent
While in battle, colored icons will\nappear beside each Pok\emon's\lhealth bars.\pThese icons show the Pok\emon's\ntypes!

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_AdvancedCourse_MegaEvolutionStudent
Researchers from the\nInterdimensional Research Facility\lhave been working closely with\lKalosian scientists to bring the\lpower of Mega Evolution to Kulure!\pThis allows trainers with strong\nbonds to their Pok\emon to push\lpast their limits.

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_AdvancedCourse_TMsStudent
Scientists from the Unova region\nrecently discovered how to make\lTMs reusable!

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_AdvancedCourse_HMsStudent
Did you know?\pHMs can now be used without being\ntaught, as long as you have the\lnecessary badge and a Pok\emon\lcompatible with the move!\pBecause of this, HMs can be\nreplaced in a Pok\emon's moveset\lwithout seeing the Move Deleter.\pHow handy!

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_AdvancedCourse_DexNavStudent
Professor Hawthorn has been\ncollaborating with researchers from\lHoenn to bring their DexNav\linvention over to Kulure. Using one\lmakes it easier to find rare or\lpowerful Pok\emon, but I heard the\ldevices are very hard to come by.
