My professor said these Pok\emon\nfossils were imported from the\lKanto region across the sea.

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_MainRoom_Librarian
We have many books on Pok\emon and\nPok\emon battles. You can learn a\llot from reading!

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_MainRoom_Professor
I'm reviewing our students' test\nscores to see how effective our\lcourses are.

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_MainRoom_TerrainTutor_Intro
In my time, I have become a\nproficient Pok\emon move tutor. I\lcan teach your Pok\emon terrain\lmoves.

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_MainRoom_TerrainTutor_DoesNotHaveBadge
Unfortunately, I cannot teach you\nuntil you have acquired the Terrain\lBadge from the Rhodanzi City Gym.\pPlease come back once you have it,\nand I'll be happy to teach your\lPok\emon!

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_MainRoom_TerrainTutor_Confirmation
To teach your Pok\emon, I will\nrequire 5 Pok\eChips as payment. Is\lthis acceptable? (Held: [BUFFER1])

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_MainRoom_TerrainTutor_NotEnoughPokeChips
I'm sorry, but you don't have enough\nPok\eChips to cover my fee.

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_MainRoom_TerrainTutor_ConfirmationAccepted
Very well! Which move would you like\nto teach?

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_MainRoom_TerrainTutor_Complete
That concludes our session! Come see\nme again if you'd like to teach\lmore terrain moves.

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_MainRoom_TerrainTutor_ConfirmationRejected
I understand. If you change your\nmind, I will be here later.

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_BasicCourse_Professor
Welcome to the Rhodanzi Trainer\nSchool's Basic Course.\pNew trainers can learn the basics\nbefore departing on their Pok\emon\ljourneys.

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_BasicCourse_AbilitiesStudent
Abilities are passive effects a\nPok\emon can have that impacts how\lthey perform in battle or in the\lfield. All Pok\emon have an ability!

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_BasicCourse_KOStudent
When a Pok\emon's HP reaches 0, it\ngets knocked out.\pIf all of a trainer's Pok\emon are\nknocked out, they'll black out and\llose money.\pBe careful not to let that happen\nto your Pok\emon!

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_BasicCourse_HeldItemsStudent
A Pok\emon can hold one item in\nbattle, which may activate when\lcertain conditions are met.\pPok\emon can't use man-made items\nthough.

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_BasicCourse_StatusStudent
I'm the smartest in my class, when it\ncomes to status effects!

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_BasicCourse_StatusStudent_Question
Which status effect would you like\nto learn about?

#org @gText_BurnDetails
Burned Pok\emon will take damage\neach turn. Their attack stat will\lalso be halved.

#org @gText_FrostbiteDetails
Frostbitten Pok\emon will take damage\neach turn. Their special attack\lstat will also be cut in half.\pUsing certain fire type moves will\ncure the Pok\emon's frostbite\lthough!

#org @gText_ParalysisDetails
Paralyzed Pok\emon have a fifty\npercent chance of being unable to\lmove. Their speed is also reduced\lto half.

#org @gText_PoisonDetails
Poisoned Pok\emon take damage each\nturn. Some moves, like Toxic, will\leven apply Bad Poison which makes\lthe Pok\emon take more damage on\leach turn.

#org @gText_SleepDetails
Sleeping Pok\emon can't act until\nthey've woken up. Some moves can\lonly be used while asleep, or only\lon sleeping Pok\emon.

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_BasicCourse_StatusStudent_Done
I hope this information was\nhelpful!\pThere are also a lot of temporary\nstatuses, but I don't know them all\lyet.

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_BasicCourse_TypeStudent_QuizIntro
I'm a quiz fanatic, and I love\nquizzing new trainers. If you can\lanswer my question correctly, I'll\lgive you a prize!\pWhat do you say?

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_BasicCourse_TypeStudent_QuizRejected
Aww, that's too bad. If you change\nyour mind, come see me again.

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_BasicCourse_TypeStudent_QuizAccepted
Great! This will be fun.

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_BasicCourse_TypeStudent_GrassQuestion

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_BasicCourse_TypeStudent_FireQuestion
You chose a [RED]fire[BLUE] type starter.\nWhich type is it strong against?

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_BasicCourse_TypeStudent_WaterQuestion

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_BasicCourse_TypeStudent_QuizSuccess
Yes, that's correct! A smart\ntrainer like you deserves a reward.

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_BasicCourse_TypeStudent_QuizFail
I'm sorry, that isn't correct.\nRead up on Pok\emon type advantages\land come see me again, okay?

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_BasicCourse_TypeStudent_ItemInfo
Give that to your Pok\emon to\nmake their moves stronger!

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_BasicCourse_TypeStudent_QuizComplete
Good luck, trainer! Believe in\nyour Pok\emon and you'll do great.

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_AdvancedCourse_Professor
All the students here are well\nversed in CFRU features.\pI'd suggest talking with them to\nlearn about the new features\lavailable.

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_AdvancedCourse_BattleMovesStudent
You can check the effects of your\nmoves more easily in battle now!\pIf a move is super effective, it\nwill appear in [GREEN]green[BLUE], and if it's\lineffective it will appear in\l[ORANGE]yellow[BLUE].\pIf the move is bolded, it benefits\nfrom the Same Type Attack Boost,\lor STAB.\pPressing [L_BUTTON] will show you the move's\ndetails and effective power and\laccuracy.

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_AdvancedCourse_AutoRunStudent
Do you like going fast?\pYou can hold [B_BUTTON] while biking to go\nextra fast.\pIf you're on foot, you can press [L_BUTTON]\nto turn on auto-run.\pIt won't work if you have the L=A\nsetting turned on though[.]

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_AdvancedCourse_PokemonTypeStudent
While in battle, colored icons will\nappear beside each Pok\emon's\lhealth bars.\pThese icons show the Pok\emon's\ntypes!

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_AdvancedCourse_MegaEvolutionStudent
Researchers from the\nInterdimensional Research Facility\lhave been working closely with\lKalosian scientists to bring the\lpower of Mega Evolution to Kulure!\pThis allows trainers with strong\nbonds to their Pok\emon to push\lpast their limits.

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_AdvancedCourse_TMsStudent
Scientists from the Unova region\nrecently discovered how to make\lTMs reusable!

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_AdvancedCourse_HMsStudent
Did you know?\pHMs can now be used without being\ntaught, as long as you have the\lnecessary badge and a Pok\emon\lcompatible with the move!\pBecause of this, HMs can be\nreplaced in a Pok\emon's moveset\lwithout seeing the Move Deleter.\pHow handy!

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_AdvancedCourse_DexNavStudent
Professor Hawthorn has been\ncollaborating with researchers from\lHoenn to bring their DexNav\linvention over to Kulure. Using one\lmakes it easier to find rare or\lpowerful Pok\emon, but I heard the\ldevices are very hard to come by.

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_AdvancedCourse_BadgeObedienceStudent
Pok\emon can sense the strength of\ntheir trainers, and may not obey if\lthey don't trust them.\pA Pok\emon trusts any trainer, as long\nas it's below level 15. After that,\lthey will trust their trainers for\lthe next 10 levels, for each badge\learned.

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_AdvancedCourse_LastPokeball
While in battle, you can press [L_BUTTON]\nto throw the last Pok\e Ball you\lused. Handy, right?

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_AdvancedCourse_QuickRun
Tired of selecting the Run option in\nbattle? Just press [R_BUTTON]!

#org @gText_RhodanziTrainerSchool_AdvancedCourse_RegisterMultipleItems
You can register multiple key items\nto the [SELECT_BUTTON]. If you do,\lyou'll be asked which one you want\lto use.
