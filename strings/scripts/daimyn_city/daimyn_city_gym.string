[BLUE]If yer here to play the slots, then\nyou have everything you need.\pIf yer here for Chance's badge,\nthough, there are some rules you'd\lbest keep in mind[.]\pChance only challenges those that\ncan prove they're saavy gamblers\land can amass a small fortune.\pHow do you do that? Well, there are\n3 ways[.]\p1. Make Your Own Luck - This means\nbuying them from my pal here with\lyour hard earned cash.\p2. Getting Lucky - With a little\nluck, you can win more coins from\lthe slots here. Rumor has it some\lmachines are luckier than others.\p3. Playing the Field - It may not\nlook it, but most people here are\lgym trainers. If you beat them in\lbattle, they'll give you some\lcoins.
