Pop Quiz: Is a Quick Ball better\nthan a Timer Ball?

#org @gText_HeleoCityFacilities_QuickTimerBallAnswer
Haha, it was a trick question!\pA Quick Ball is most effective during\nthe first turn of battle, but\lbecomes less effective over time.\pA Timer Ball is the opposite. It's\nonly most effective after 10 turns\lhave passed.\pDeciding the best time to use each is\nkey.

#org @gText_HeleoCityFacilities_QuickTimerBallGift
I like your spirit! Here, have a\nQuick and Timer Ball, on me.

Whew[.] I just can't get this new\nruleset in my head. I keep battling\las if these were regular battles!

#org @gText_HeleoCityFacilities_TrainerHouse_Girl
Did you know? The trainers at the\nTrainer House will Pok\emon that\lmatch your team's highest level.\pThat makes the battles harder, but\nit also means your Pok\emon will\learn more experience when they win.\pPretty good deal, don't you think?

[BLUE]Me, oh my, where are my manners?\pTrainer Houses are a hip new\nsensation hitting the Kulure region,\lspearheaded by yours truly.\pThe premise is nice and simple: fight\nbattles to win great prizes!\pEach trainer house has a different\nruleset that changes how battles\lwill play out.\pThis is a back-to-back gauntlet\nagainst 3 trainers who know this\lruleset like the back of their\lhands.\pYou'll earn prizes depending\non how well you do, and you'll\leven get a special prize the first\ltime you defeat all 3.\pBest of all - you'll earn experience\nand money each time you compete.\lIsn't that just swell?\pBut, there is a catch[.] You can only\nchallenge each trainer house once\lper day. Gotta keep things fresh\lfor spectators, ya dig?
