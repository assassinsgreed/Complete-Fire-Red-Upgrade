My son and I from Daimyn City. We\ncame out this way to visit our\lrelatives.\pIt's nice here, but I think he's\ngetting a little homesick.

#org @gText_HeleoCityFacilities_CriticalCapture
Have you ever seen a Pok\e Ball\nshake before a Pok\emon you're\ltrying to catch gets pulled into\lit?\pThat's a Critical Capture. When it\nhappens, you'll be more likely to\lcatch the Pok\emon than usual.\pI hear it's more likely to happen\nwhen you've caught more\lunique Pok\emon species[.]

Pop Quiz: Is a Quick Ball better\nthan a Timer Ball?

#org @gText_HeleoCityFacilities_QuickTimerBallAnswer
Haha, it was a trick question!\pA Quick Ball is most effective during\nthe first turn of battle, but\lbecomes less effective over time.\pA Timer Ball is the opposite. It's\nonly most effective after 10 turns\lhave passed.\pDeciding the best time to use each is\nkey.

I like your spirit! Here, have a\nQuick and Timer Ball, on me.

Did you know? The trainers at the\nTrainer House will Pok\emon that\lmatch your team's highest level.\pThat makes the battles harder, but\nit also means your Pok\emon will\learn more experience when they win.\pPretty good deal, don't you think?

You're a Pok\emon trainer, yes?\pTo the west lies Route 8. It's a\nroundabout path to Daimyn City,\lbut a safer one.\pThere is an abandoned building along\nthe way. I'd urge you not to go\lthere; it could be dangerous.
