[BLACK]Alistair:[BLUE] A good friend of mine lives\nto the south, near Ferrox Village.\pI was on my way to visit him when I\nspotted some Team Pluto thugs in\lthe area.\pMy friend is an expert refiner. In\nparticular, he specializes in\lrefining the ashes from Mount\lCarnelidge into mega stones.\pThese mega stones allow certain\nspecies of Pok\emon to Mega Evolve,\lallowing them to tap into their\lfull potential in battle.\pTeam Pluto aims to harass him into\ngiving them mega stones, of that I\lam certain.\pAs gifted as my friend is at refining\nashes, he is not a Pok\emon trainer.\pI am concerned they will take\nadvantage of this, and threaten him\lto get what they want.\pPlease, may I ask you both for\nyour assistance, before they hurt\lhim?
