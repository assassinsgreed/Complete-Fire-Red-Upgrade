I love swimming and battling! Let's\ndo both!

#org @gText_Route15North_SwimmerMiles_Defeat
Wow, you're as strong as the current!

#org @gText_Route15North_SwimmerMiles_Chat
Swimming helps me train my Pok\emon.\nThey've become quite strong!

#org @gText_Route15North_SwimmerFiona_Intro
The ocean's waves are my rhythm.\nReady to dance in a battle?

#org @gText_Route15North_SwimmerFiona_Defeat
Your rhythm is stronger than the\nocean's waves!

#org @gText_Route15North_SwimmerFiona_Chat
Battling while swimming is a great\nway to sync with my Pok\emon.

#org @gText_Route15North_HikerKlaus_Intro
What's that? You're wondering why a\nhiker is out at sea?\pBeat me, and maybe I'll tell you!

#org @gText_Route15North_HikerKlaus_Defeat
Oho! A resounding defeat.

#org @gText_Route15North_HikerKlaus_Chat
Alright, I'll tell you why I'm out\nhere[.]\pI love mountains, because they're\nmade out of rocks!\pSimilarly, I also love Rock type\nPok\emon!\pI heard there are interesting Rock\ntype Pok\emon that can be fished up\lin the ocean routes.\pI came running when I heard that!\pBut[.] I can't find them here[.] Maybe\nthey're on one of the other routes?

#org @gText_Route15North_SwimmerUrsula_Intro
I'm looking for rare Pok\emon, but\ninstead I've found a trainer.

#org @gText_Route15North_SwimmerUrsula_Defeat
Oh, what a rare trainer!

#org @gText_Route15North_SwimmerUrsula_Chat
Route 15 is so long that we refer\nto it's northern and southern halves\lseparately.\pBut, Pok\emon don't care about that!\nThe same species can be found in\lboth halves.\pDid you know that already?

#org @gText_Route15North_SwimmerQuincy_Intro
I'm an exceptional swimmer, but an\neven more exceptional trainer.\pHere, I'll show you!

#org @gText_Route15North_SwimmerQuincy_Defeat
Truly exceptional!

#org @gText_Route15North_SwimmerQuincy_Chat
You're an exceptional trainer too! I\nfeel we could be good friends.

#org @gText_Route15North_CoolTrainerWesley_Intro
Hmph. All the trainers here are weak.\nAre you weak too?

#org @gText_Route15North_CoolTrainerWesley_Defeat
Not weak[.] Strong!

#org @gText_Route15North_CoolTrainerWesley_Chat
Hmph. You made my day.\pI hope you'll keep going and become\neven stronger.

#org @gText_Route15North_SuperNerdEthan_Intro
Prepare to be dazzled by my rare\nPok\emon[.] You can't beat them!

#org @gText_Route15North_SuperNerdEthan_Defeat
No way! They were supposed to be\nunbeatable.

#org @gText_Route15North_SuperNerdEthan_Chat
Okay, you're strong. I get that now,\nsheesh.

#org @gText_Route15North_ChannelerLila_Intro
You[.] A curse hangs over you.\nUehehehe!

#org @gText_Route15North_ChannelerLila_Defeat
That curse is now over me[.]

#org @gText_Route15North_ChannelerLila_Chat
The sea is soothing on it's surface.\pBut[.] It hides unspeakable horrors\nbeneath the waves. Uehehehe!

#org @gText_Route15North_RestStopAdvertisementSign

// South
#org @gText_Route15South_NursePrompt
Welcome to the Route 15 Rest Stop!\pIf you'd like, I can heal your weary\nPok\emon.

#org @gText_Route15South_NurseHealing
Okay, please let me see your\nPok\emon for a moment[.]

#org @gText_Route15South_NurseHealingDone
There. They're looking much better!

#org @gText_Route15South_NurseOutro
Please come see me again, if you are\nin need of healing.

#org @gText_Route15South_Shopkeeper
Welcome! I sell refreshments to keep\nyour Pok\emon feeling refreshed.

#org @gText_Route15South_ShopkeeperDone
Come again!

#org @gText_Route15South_Boy
This rest stop really saved my\nhide.\pMy Pok\emon were feeling pretty worn\nout before stopping here.\pTalk about convenient!

#org @gText_Route15South_RuinManiac
I've heard rumours that a legendary\nPok\emon rests somewhere nearby.\pI'm going to be the first person to\ndiscover it, just you wait and see!

#org @gText_Route15South_SwimmerGerald_Intro
I'm Gerald, a swimmer who loves\nthe open sea and its Pok\emon.

#org @gText_Route15South_SwimmerGerald_Defeat
You're a strong trainer. I admire\nyour skills.

#org @gText_Route15South_SwimmerGerald_Chat
The sea is full of surprises. Just\nlike our battle.

#org @gText_Route15South_SwimmerAlexandra_Intro
Hey you, do you like waves?

#org @gText_Route15South_SwimmerAlexandra_Defeat
Um[.] I asked if you liked waves, not\nbattles.

#org @gText_Route15South_SwimmerAlexandra_Chat
Sometimes I like to float on the\nwaves and let them carry me\laround.

#org @gText_Route15South_SwimmerBernard_Intro
My battle strategy is as bold and in-\nyour-face as my speedo is!

#org @gText_Route15South_SwimmerBernard_Defeat
Oooh! What a trunks-like battle\nstrategy that was.

#org @gText_Route15South_SwimmerBernard_Chat
Speedos rock! They show off more of\nmy sick bod!

#org @gText_Route15South_SwimmerHarold_Intro
I'll battle you with the Pok\emon I\njust caught!

#org @gText_Route15South_SwimmerHarold_Defeat
Hm[.] Maybe I ought to throw them\nback instead.

#org @gText_Route15South_SwimmerHarold_Chat
Catching Pok\emon on your fishing line\nis quite the thrill, isn't it?

#org @gText_Route15South_SwimmerMelinda_Intro
You want a battle? Okay, well let's\nmake it quick. I'm busy.

#org @gText_Route15South_SwimmerMelinda_Defeat
Very quick, indeed.

#org @gText_Route15South_SwimmerMelinda_Chat
I heard there's a secluded island\naround here somewhere.

#org @gText_Route15South_BlackbeltFranklin_Intro
My Pok\emon and I are as strong as a\ncoursing river.\pThink you can handle us, when we're\nthis powerful?

#org @gText_Route15South_BlackbeltFranklin_Defeat
Whoa! You're like a great typhoon\nyourself.

#org @gText_Route15South_BlackbeltFranklin_Chat
It seems my Pok\emon and I must get\nback to our training.\pWe are too weak.

#org @gText_Route15South_SwimmerPatricia_Intro
Tee hee! A trainer must battle when\ntheir eyes meet, even out here.

#org @gText_Route15South_SwimmerPatricia_Defeat
A trainer must also accept defeat\nwith grace, even out here[.]

#org @gText_Route15South_SwimmerPatricia_Chat
I don't see many trainers out here,\nso I simply must battle those I\lsee.

#org @gText_Route15South_RestStopSign
Route 15 Rest Stop\nFreshen up here!\pBattling on this island is strictly\nprohibited.
