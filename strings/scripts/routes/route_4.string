A recent landslide has blocked the\npath to Ferrox Village.\pPlease be patient with us while we\nclear the way, and do not enter\lTorma Cave.

#org @gText_Route4_WorkerChat
Huagh! These rocks sure are heavy.\nIt will take some time to get these\lcleared[.]

#org @gText_Route4_LargeManChat
The road is blocked? I can't believe\nmy bad luck.

#org @gText_Route4_LassChat
I was supposed to meet my boyfriend\ntoday. I hope it won't take long to\lclear the path[.]

Trainer Tips!\nSome routes have paths that are\lonly accessible when your Pok\emon\lcan use HM moves. Return often to\ldiscover new things!

We may be camping, but my Pok\emon\nare always ready to battle.

#org @gText_Route4_CamperPietro_Defeat
You must've been ready to battle\ntoo!

#org @gText_Route4_CamperPietro_Chat
I love to go camping with my\nPok\emon!

#org @gText_Route4_PsychicAdriano_Intro
I predicted you would come here.

#org @gText_Route4_PsychicAdriano_Defeat
I predicted you would win, too.

#org @gText_Route4_PsychicAdriano_Chat
My predictions are never wrong.

#org @gText_Route4_BeautyBeatrice_Intro
Do you prefer cute Pok\emon, or\nstrong ones?

#org @gText_Route4_BeautyBeatrice_Defeat
Oh, your Pok\emon are cute and\nstrong!

#org @gText_Route4_BeautyBeatrice_Chat
I like using cute Pok\emon, and I\ndon't care if I lose battles\lbecause of that.

#org @gText_Route4_LadyAlda_Intro
Spin, my beautiful umbrella!

#org @gText_Route4_LadyAlda_Defeat
Hm, you're quite strong.

#org @gText_Route4_LadyAlda_Chat
There's nothing quite like an\numbrella to shade you from the\lsun. Do you not agree?

#org @gText_Route4_LassIsabela_Intro
What kind of trainer are you?

#org @gText_Route4_LassIsabela_Defeat
Oh, you're one of those, huh?

#org @gText_Route4_LassIsabela_Chat
There are a lot of different trainer\ntypes out there, hey?

#org @gText_Route4_BirdKeeperRowley_Intro
My Pok\emon can fly at mach 3. No,\nmach 4!

#org @gText_Route4_BirdKeeperRowley_Defeat
Weren't you impressed by our speed?

#org @gText_Route4_BirdKeeperRowley_Chat
Flying type Pok\emon are great!

#org @gText_Route4_CrushGirlElise_Intro
My Pok\emon and I train our bodies\nevery day. Do you think you can\lchallenge us?

#org @gText_Route4_CrushGirlElise_Defeat
So formidable[.]

#org @gText_Route4_CrushGirlElise_Chat
A good training regime is important\nto bringing out your inner strength.

#org @gText_Route4_GentlemanPorter_Intro
Why, hello there, young trainer.\nMight I interest you in a battle\lwith a gentleman like me?

#org @gText_Route4_GentlemanPorter_Defeat
You are quite gifted!

#org @gText_Route4_GentlemanPorter_Chat
I daresay, I did not expect your\nPok\emon to be so strong.

#org @gText_Route4_BirdKeeperLuca_Intro
Fufufufu[.] Go, my precious birds!

#org @gText_Route4_BirdKeeperLuca_Defeat
Ahhh, my bird Pok\emon!

#org @gText_Route4_BirdKeeperLuca_Chat
Birds need special care. They're a\nlot more complex than other\lPok\emon.

[BLUE]Hey! Did you just come from Torma\nCave?

#org @gText_Route4_PlayerHonest
[BLUE]I see[.] At least you fessed up.

#org @gText_Route4_PlayerDishonest
[BLUE]Don't lie to me[.] I just saw you\nwalk out!

#org @gText_Route4_ForemanBeratesPlayer
[BLUE]Listen, kid.\pI know you're impatient, but you\nshould've just waited for us to\lfinish clearing the way.\pTorma Cave is dangerous, and I\ncould've gotten in a lot of trouble\lif you'd gotten hurt.

#org @gText_Route4_ForemanConcedes
[BLUE]Sigh[.] But what's done is done, I\nsuppose. You're no worse for wear.

#org @gText_Route4_ForemanLeaves
[BLUE]Look, the way is clear now, so\nthere's no need to put yourself in\ldanger, you hear?\pI'll be leaving to reunite with my\ncrew in Heleo City now. Stay out\lof trouble, alright?
