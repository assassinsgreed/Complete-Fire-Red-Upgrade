Danger! Wild Pokemon have been\nsighted. Please be careful.

#org @gText_Route17_MetWithRival
[BLUE]There you are, [PLAYER]. Look!\nChampion Selene is right there!

#org @gText_Route17_RivalCallingToChampion
[BLUE]Um[.] Excuse me, Champion Selene?

#org @gText_Route17_ChampionResponse
[RED]Oh? Who's this?

#org @gText_Route17_RivalStammer
[BLUE]I[.] uh[.] I'm[.]

#org @gText_Route17_HawthorneDismisses
[BLUE]Excuse me, young man. We're\nperforming some important field\lresearch and I must ask you to\lleave.

#org @gText_Route17_RivalProtest
[BLUE]But[.]

#org @gText_Route17_SeleneInterjection
[RED]Now, now. We aren't that busy, right?\nSurely we can hear him out.

#org @gText_Route17_HawthorneYields
[BLUE]Harrumph. As you wish, Selene.

#org @gText_Route17_HawthornePromptsRival
[BLUE]Young man, you may speak.

#org @gText_Route17_RivalGratitude
[BLUE]Oh[.] Oh! Thank you Mister, um[.]

#org @gText_Route17_HawthorneIntroduction
[BLUE]Professor Hawthorne, my child.

#org @gText_Route17_RivalStartsExplanation
[BLUE]Well, you see, Professor Hawthorne[.]

#org @gText_Route17_UrgePlayerToJoin
[BLUE]Hey, [PLAYER], you should introduce\nyourself too!

#org @gText_Route17_RivalsRequest
[BLUE]My friend, [PLAYER], and I have been\nbig fans of Champion Selene ever\lsince she became champion.\pShe's really nice, and strong, and\nhas never lost a fight. She's so\lcool!\pWe saw her crowning match, and ever\nsince then we've been dying to get\lher autograph.\pSo[.] if it isn't too much trouble[.]\ncould we get one?

#org @gText_Route17_SelenesResponse
[RED]That's all?

#org @gText_Route17_RivalEmbarrassed
[BLUE]Uh, well[.] Yeah, sorry. I know you're\nreally busy and it's a dumb thing\lto ask[.]

#org @gText_Route17_SeleneFollowUp
[RED]No, not at all! I just assumed\nthat you would ask for an\lendorsement to take the Pok\emon\lLeague challenge.

#org @gText_Route17_RivalTrainerInterest
[BLUE]I wish! That would be so cool.\pBut[.] we aren't Pok\emon trainers. Not\nyet, at least. Our moms won't let\lus go on a journey yet.

#org @gText_Route17_SeleneProposesStarterPokemon
[RED]Hey, Professor Hawthorne, how about\nwe give them some starter Pok\emon?

#org @gText_Route17_HawthorneHesitant
[BLUE]I don't know, they're awfully young,\nSelene.

#org @gText_Route17_SeleneRespondsToHesitation
[RED]I was younger than they are, when\nI started my journey five years ago.

#org @gText_Route17_HawthorneDigsIn
[BLUE]You were, and still are, an\nexceptional trainer, Selene. Not\lall trainers can achieve what you\lhave.

#org @gText_Route17_SelenesProposal
[RED]I've got a good feeling about\nthem!\pHow about this? If their parents\nallow them to have a Pok\emon,\lwould that be okay with you?

#org @gText_Route17_HawthorneAccepts
[BLUE]Well[.] Alright. But only if their\nmothers are okay with it.

#org @gText_Route17_SeleneSendsPlayerOff
[RED]Well, that's that! If you're serious\nabout becoming trainers, you'd\lbetter talk to your moms soon.

#org @gText_Route17_RivalExcited
[BLUE]Oh! Oh! Okay! I'll be right back!

#org @gText_Route17_RivalHeadsOut
[BLUE][PLAYER], you'd better hurry up too.\nWe don't want to miss out on this\lopportunity.

#org @gText_Route17_HawthorneChat
Run along and speak with your\nmothers. But do hurry, we must be\lleaving soon.

#org @gText_Route17_SeleneChat
[RED]You must be excited to start your\nPok\emon journey!

#org @gText_Route17_HawthorneBlocker
[BLUE]That cave is dangerous! I would\nadvise you not to go in there\lwithout having a Pok\emon.

#org @gText_Route17_RivalExcitedToBecomeTrainer
[BLUE]I'm so excited, [PLAYER]! We're going\nto be Pok\emon trainers after today!

#org @gText_Route17_SeleneBeforeChoosingStarter
[RED]It's always exciting to see a new\ntrainer start their journey!

#org @gText_Route17_ChooseAStarterWarning
You should choose a Pok\emon while\nyou have the chance[.]

#org @gText_Route17_HawthorneDialogWhenChoosingStarter
You were able to get your mothers'\nblessing, yes?\pVery well, then I shall not object\nto you going on a Pok\emon journey.

#org @gText_Route17_HawthorneChooseAPokemon
I have 3 Pok\emon with me today. You\nmay both choose one to take as\lyour companion.

#org @gText_Route17_HawthorneAsksPlayerToMove
[BLUE]Please excuse me for a moment,\n[PLAYER].

#org @gText_Route17_RivalWantsToTakeEevee 
[BLUE]Oh, thank you, Professor Hawthorne.\pBut[.] I've been thinking for a bit,\nand I'd like to travel with my\lEevee.

#org @gText_Route17_HawthorneRespondsToRivalsEeveeChoice
[BLUE]Are you certain, [RIVAL]? You could\ntravel with your Eevee and one of\lthese Pok\emon, if you'd like.

#org @gText_Route17_RivalWillTakeEevee
[BLUE]Yeah, I've made up my mind. I think\nit'll make my journey more special.

#org @gText_Route17_HawthorneAcceptsRivalsEeveeChoice
[BLUE]Hohoho, very well. I can respect\nthat decision.

#org @gText_Route17_HawthorneInvitesPlayerToChooseStarter
[BLUE][PLAYER], you may choose any Pok\emon\nyou like. Think over your decision\lcarefully.

#org @gText_Route17_SeleneAdviceOnChoosingPartner
[RED]The Pok\emon you choose will be\nyour partner throughout your\ljourney.

#org @gText_StarterChoice_Confirmation
[BLUE]Ah, so you'd like to choose\n[BUFFER1] as your partner?

#org @gText_StarterChoice_Decline
[BLUE]Take your time! This is an important\ndecision.

#org @gText_StarterChoice_Confirmed
[PLAYER] chose to start their journey\nwith [BUFFER1]!

#org @gText_StarterChoice_Nickname
[BLUE]That's a fine choice! Would you like\nto give your new partner a\lnickname?

#org @gText_StarterChoice_Finalized
[BLUE]That settles it. You and [BUFFER1]\nare now partners.

#org @gText_Route17_HawthorneGettingPokeballs
[BLUE]I'll just collect these[.]

#org @gText_Route17_HawthornePreparingToLeave
[BLUE]My, my[.] Look at the time.

#org @gText_Route17_HawthorneThankingSeleneForTime
[BLUE]I must be going. Selene, thank you\nfor your time today.

#org @gText_Route17_SeleneRespondingToHawthornesThanks
[RED]Oh, don't sweat it, it was a lot of\nfun!

#org @gText_Route17_HawthorneRespondingToSelene
[BLUE]The pleasure is all mine.

#org @gText_Route17_HawthorneDeparts
[BLUE][PLAYER], [RIVAL], I'm sure you must\nbe excited to start your\ljourneys.\pI'd like to ask you to first meet me\nat my lab in Olenic Town first. I\lhave a gift I'd like to give you.\pAnd with that, I must be off.

#org @gText_Route17_SeleneSuggestsBattle
[RED]Why don't you two try a Pok\emon\nbattle to get used to your new\lpartners?

#org @gText_Route17_RivalWantsToBattle
[BLUE]That sounds fun! Come on, [PLAYER],\nlet's battle. Show me what you've\lgot!

#org @gText_Route17_RivalBattleConcludes
That was a lot of fun! You're a good\nbattler, [PLAYER].

#org @gText_Route17_SeleneCommentsOnBattle
[RED]A battle between two friends[.] You\ntwo are officially rivals now! Push\leach other to become the best\ltrainers you can be.

#org @gText_Route17_SeleneDeparture
[RED]I have to go now too, but I expect\nto see you both again someday,\lmaybe even in a championship\lbattle!\pGood luck, trainers.

#org @gText_Route17_RivalDepartsForHawthornesLab
[BLUE]We're Pok\emon trainers, [PLAYER]. I\ncan't believe it!\pI'm gonna catch some Pok\emon before\ngoing to Professor Hawthorne's lab.\lI'll see you there.
