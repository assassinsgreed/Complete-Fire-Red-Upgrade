If you don't stretch, you could hurt\nyourself or your Pok\emon badly.

I foresee your Pok\emon, frozen in\nutter terror!

#org @gText_Route12East_PsychicTony_Defeat
Guh? It was my Pok\emon that would\nfreeze up?

#org @gText_Route12East_PsychicTony_Chat
Be careful not to catch frostbite.\pNot only does it hurt, it makes your\nspecial attacks weaker!

Gyahaha! It's energizing to see a\nyoungster out on the Bruccie\ltrails.\pC'mon, let's battle!

#org @gText_Route12East_HikerDwight_Defeat
Gyahaha! Your Pok\emon are just as\nenergized as you are!

#org @gText_Route12East_HikerDwight_Chat
Remember to keep warm out there.\nThe Bruccie trail is unforgiving.

My Pok\emon are fast, like really\nfast. Think you can keep up?

#org @gText_Route12East_TriathleteTrixie_Defeat
Good job!

Slow or fast, it doesn't matter.\nPlay to your Pok\emons' strengths.

Good day. Shall we battle?

#org @gText_Route12East_GentlemanGeoffrey_Defeat
I say, that was quite enjoyable.

#org @gText_Route12East_GentlemanGeoffrey_Chat
I picked up Pok\emon battling as a\nhobby.\pWhat I didn't expect was for my\nPok\emon to become my trusted\lcompanions.
