Hm. Maybe a dirge is more fitting?

A good artist can take in their\nenvironment and use it to inspire\ltheir music.

I'm pretending to fish, so I can\nenjoy some "Me\" time.

#org @gText_Route11North_FishermanJonah_Defeat
My rod snapped!

Did you know? These ponds were dug\nout by the citizens of Laplaz Town.\pThere are no Pok\emon to be found in\nthem, as a result.
