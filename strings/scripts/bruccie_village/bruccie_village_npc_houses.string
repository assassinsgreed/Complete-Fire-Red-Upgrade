Howdy! I'm something of an expert\nwhen it comes to Pok\emon moves.\pI can teach your Pok\emon some of\nthese incredible moves.\pAll I require in exchange is 10\nPok\eChips.\pWhat do you say?\n(Held: [BUFFER1])

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_ConfirmationAccepted
Excellent! These are the moves I\ncan teach your Pok\emon.

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_Complete
Your Pok\emon has learned the move\nperfectly!\pCome see me again, if you'd like to\nteach another Pok\emon a new move.

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_TutoringRejected
I understand.\pPlease, come see me again if you\nchange your mind.

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_NotEnoughPokeChips
I'm sorry, but you do not have\nenough Pok\eChips.\pThese moves are worth the cost, I\nassure you.

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_PokeballSwapper_Intro
Shh! Can you keep a secret?\nI've cracked the code[.]\pI've learned how to move a\nPok\emon to a different Pok\e Ball!\pThe Pok\e Ball manufacturers don't\nwant you to know this is possible.\pIt's our little secret, okay?

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_PokeballSwapper_NotSkilled
There's just one problem[.]\nI'm not very good yet.\pYou'll lose the ball the Pok\emon\nused to be in as a result.

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_PokeballSwapper_Skilled
I've gotten pretty good at doing\nthis.\pI can return the Pok\emon's old Pok\e\nBall to you when I'm done.

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_PokeballSwapper_Confirmation
It'll cost 2 Pok\eChips.\pWhat do you say? Want to do it?\n(Held: [BUFFER1])

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_PokeballSwapper_NotEnoughChips
Hey[.] You don't have enough\nPok\eChips.

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_PokeballSwapper_ChoseNotToChangePokeball
Alright. If you change your mind,\ncome see me.\pAnd remember - don't tell anyone\nabout this!

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_PokeballSwapper_AskToChoosePokemon
Okay, which Pok\emon would you like\nto change the ball of?

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_PokeballSwapper_TradedPokemon
[BUFFER1] was given to you by another\ntrainer.\pIt would be rude of me to change\nit's Pok\e Ball.

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_PokeballSwapper_PokemonInCherishBall
[BUFFER1] is in a Cherish Ball.\nIt's special; I cannot change it.

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_PokeballSwapper_PokemonChoiceConfirmation
[BUFFER1] is inside of a [BUFFER2]\nright now.\pThis is the Pok\emon you want to\nchange the ball for?

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_PokeballSwapper_PokeballConfirmation
Great! And which Pok\e Ball would\nyou like me to move it to?

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_PokeballSwapper_ChoseANonPokeball
I can't put it in a\n[BUFFER1][.]

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_PokeballSwapper_ChoseSamePokeball
It's already in a [BUFFER1][.]

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_PokeballSwapper_BallSwapConfirmation
You want to move your [BUFFER1]\nfrom a [BUFFER2] to a [BUFFER3]?

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_PokeballSwapper_CollectPokechips
Okay, let's do this!\pI'll just get those Pok\eChips from\nyou[.]

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_PokeballSwapper_StartingProcess
Now, turn around please[.]\nThis is a secret process.

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_PokeballSwapper_Working
Hm[.] Let's move this, then pop this\nopen[.]\pAh!\pOh, there we go.\pAnd then[.]

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_PokeballSwapper_ProcessComplete
It's done! Your [BUFFER1] was moved\ninto a [BUFFER3] successfully.

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_PokeballSwapper_OldBallBroke
Unfortunately, the old ball was\ndestroyed[.]\pBut I feel like I'm improving.

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_PokeballSwapper_Improved
Great news! I've perfected my\ncraft!\pI can move your Pok\emon without\nbreaking the old ball now!

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_PokeballSwapper_BallReturned
And here's the [BUFFER2] that\nyour [BUFFER1] used to be in.

#org @gText_BruccieVillageNPCHouses_PokeballSwapper_Completed
Come see me again, if you'd like to\nchange another Pok\emon's ball.
