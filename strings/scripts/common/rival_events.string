Oh, [PLAYER], perfect timing! I found\na rare Pok\emon but I'm having a\lhard time catching it.\pCan I have 5 Pok\e Balls? I'll make it\nworth your while! Please?

#org @gText_RivalEvent1_Declined
Aww, that's too bad, but I get it!\nIf you change your mind, I'll be\lhere for a while longer.

#org @gText_RivalEvent1_NotEnoughPokeballs
I appreciate the offer, but it looks\nlike you're a little short! I really\lneed 5, just in case it breaks out.

#org @gText_RivalEvent1_ThankPlayer
Thanks, [PLAYER]! You're a real life\nsaver. I can totally catch this\lPok\emon now!

#org @gText_RivalEvent1_GiveMoney
Here, take this. It's the least I can\ndo!

#org @gText_RivalEvent2_RequestRevive
Oh, [PLAYER], perfect timing! I've run\ninto another bind.\pI was training up for the Ferrox\nGym, and my Eevee fainted. It's\ltotally my fault too[.]\pCould you do me a favor and give me\na Revive?

#org @gText_RivalEvent2_Declined
Yeah, I understand. It's totally my\nfault that Eevee got hurt.\pTry not to worry about it, okay?\nEevee and I will get out of here\lsoon enough.

#org @gText_RivalEvent2_NotEnoughRevives
That's awfully kind of you, [PLAYER],\nbut it looks like you don't have\lany on you right now.

#org @gText_RivalEvent2_GiveRevive
You're the best friend a guy could\nask for!\pHere, [PLAYER], these are for you. I\nfound them while exploring and I'd\llike you to have them.

#org @gText_RivalEvent2_EventComplete
Thanks, [PLAYER]! We'll catch up at\nthe gym later.

#org @gText_RivalEvent3_RequestEgg
Hey, check it out [PLAYER]! My\nPok\emon laid an egg!\pThat's so cool, isn't it?\pHey, I have an idea[.] Want to trade\none of your eggs for mine? We\lcould keep what's in them a secret\luntil they hatch.

#org @gText_RivalEvent3_Declined
No worries. I'll be sticking around\nhere for a while, if you change\lyour mind.

#org @gText_RivalEvent3_ChooseEgg
Aw yeah! This'll be fun, you'll see.\nPick whichever egg you'd like, and\lI'll do the same.

#org @gText_RivalEvent3_DidNotChooseEgg
Aw, c'mon, [PLAYER]! We can trade\nregular Pok\emon any time.\lLet's trade eggs instead!

#org @gText_RivalEvent3_ConfirmEggChoice
Are you sure that's the one you want\nto trade? There are no take-backs.

#org @gText_RivalEvent3_RejectedEggChoice
Don't sweat it. We can trade later if\nyou're still interested.\pI'll be here for a while.

#org @gText_RivalEvent3_AcceptedEggChoice
Alright, let's swap!

#org @gText_RivalEvent3_EggTradeCompleted
[BLACK]Traded eggs with [RIVAL]!

#org @gText_RivalEvent3_EggTradeConcluded
[BLUE]This was really fun, [PLAYER]! I\ncan't wait to see what your egg\lhatches into.

#org @gText_RivalEvent4_FishingRecordChallenge
Hey, [PLAYER]! Fancy running into you\nhere.\pI was just taking a break with some\nfishing. I don't mean to brag, but\lI'm pretty good at it!\pMy record is reeling in 10 Pok\emon in\na single day! Think you can beat\lthat?

#org @gText_RivalEvent4_NotEnoughFishCaught
Hmm[.] Looks like you only caught\n[BUFFER1] Pok\emon today.\pYou haven't beaten my record, but I\nthink you can do it.\pRemember, you don't have to catch\nthe Pok\emon in a Pok\e Ball for it\lto count. You just have to get it\lon the line.\pI'll be hanging around for a while,\nin case you want to try again.

#org @gText_RivalEvent4_EnoughFishCaught
Wow, you've caught [BUFFER1] Pok\emon\ntoday, [PLAYER]! Incredible!\pWell, you beat me fair and square,\nso I think it's only fair that I\lgive you these.

#org @gText_RivalEvent4_ChallengeOvercome
That was fun, [PLAYER]! We should\nhave a fishing competition again\lsometime.\pI won't lose next time, though! Haha!
