It's my day off, so instead of\nhealing your Pok\emon I'll make them\lfaint instead!

#org @gText_RubarrDesert_NurseJaina_Defeat
Oh dear!

#org @gText_RubarrDesert_NurseJaina_Chat
Sorry, I let my frustration get the\nbetter of me! Let me heal your\lPok\emon up[.]

Go, my beautiful bird Pok\emon!

#org @gText_RubarrDesert_BirdKeeperNolan_Defeat
Instead of taking flight, we\ncrashed[.]

The desert weather keeps changing\nand it's hard for my birds to\lstretch their wings.

#org @gText_RubarrDesert_RuinManiacKent_Intro
Be careful where you walk! This\ndesert has great cultural\lsignificance.

#org @gText_RubarrDesert_RuinManiacKent_Defeat
Why, I never!

#org @gText_RubarrDesert_TourGuideIntro
Hey! I'm a tour guide for Rubarr\nDesert. Would you like to know\lmore about the area?

#org @gText_RubarrDesert_TourGuideDetails
Rubarr Desert is an intense desert\nwhere the weather changes\lunpredictably.\pYou'll experience sandstorms that\nwill chip away at your Pok\emon's\lhealth, or intense sun that\lstrengthens fire type moves and\lweakens water type ones.\pTake caution if you choose to\nexplore the deserts' caves. Very\lpowerful Pok\emon dwell there.\pI hope this information has been\nhelpful to you.

Hey, watch it! We're performing a,\nuh, "special mining operation\" out\lhere.

#org @gText_RubarrDesert_TeamPlutoMarcel_Defeat
N-no way!

#org @gText_RubarrDesert_TeamPlutoMarcel_Chat
Kids like you shouldn't be out here\nanyways.

#org @gText_RubarrDesert_TeamPlutoTana_Intro
Whew, it's hot out here. Why did we\nhave to pull this heist off in a\lfreaking desert?

#org @gText_RubarrDesert_TeamPlutoTana_Defeat
You aren't bothered by this heat?

#org @gText_RubarrDesert_TeamPlutoTana_Chat
I should've brought water before\ncoming out here[.]
