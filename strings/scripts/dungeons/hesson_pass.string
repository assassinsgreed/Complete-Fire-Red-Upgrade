Two trainers lock eyes in a dank\ncavern[.]\pIt's a perfect backdrop for an\nincredible battle!

#org @gText_HessonPass_HikerLuke_Defeat
Gyahaha! What a wonderful battle.

They say this cave was burrowed by\nPok\emon. Can you believe that?

#org @gText_HessonPass_ScientistHarvey_Intro
Huh? Am I a move tutor?\pHeh, sure, I'll teach your Pok\emon\nsome moves[.] The hard way!

#org @gText_HessonPass_ScientistHarvey_Defeat
Your Pok\emon know some good moves\ntoo!

#org @gText_HessonPass_ScientistHarvey_Chat
I don't teach Pok\emon moves. I'm\na soil researcher.

#org @gText_HessonPass_PsychicKimiko_Defeat
Hmm[.]

#org @gText_HessonPass_GentlemanGordy_Intro
Oh, bother. I appear to have become\nlost.\pBattle me, so I may release my\nfrustration.

#org @gText_HessonPass_GentlemanGordy_Defeat
Sigh[.] I am even more frustrated now.

#org @gText_HessonPass_GentlemanGordy_Chat
I'm trying to reach Uteya Village so\nI can see my grandchild.\pThey told me the hole I needed to\nfind was around here somewhere[.]
