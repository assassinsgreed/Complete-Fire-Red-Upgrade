W-whoa! I almost fell!

#org @gText_CalicinBay_SkierRita_Chat
[RED]I'm learning how to ski, but it's\nhard.\pAm I supposed to criss-cross, or\nkeep them straight?

Frozen out!

It's important to keep healthy while\nswimming.\pThat's especially true in a place\nlike this.

Fufufufu! Your Pok\emon will be so\ndistracted by my chiseled body\lthat they're sure to lose!

#org @gText_CalicinBay_SwimmerAngelo_Defeat
Improbable. No, impossible!

You've trained your Pok\emon well, for\nthem to ignore my incredible bod\llike that.

I think I took a wrong turn[.]\nThis isn't Emraldin Quay?

Oooh now I'm even more turned\naround.

#org @gText_CalicinBay_SwimmerSebastian_Chat
Yeah, I must've taken a wrong turn.\pIt's too cold here to be anywhere\nnear Emraldin Quay.

You think you're so cool, riding your\nPok\emon like that, huh?

#org @gText_CalicinBay_SwimmerCorrine_Defeat
Hmph. You even battle like you think\nyou're cool.

Anyone can ride their Pok\emon in the\nwater.\pIt takes a real pro to swim\neverywhere though!

#org @gText_CalicinBay_FishermanOliver_Intro
Ice fishing is the best. I can set my\nrod and battle you while I wait.

#org @gText_CalicinBay_FishermanOliver_Defeat
Oh! That's a bite!

Nyehehehe! So, we meet again,\nhuh?\pI figured you'd show up sooner or\nlater, and I was right.\pWe're expecting a shipment of Snag\nMachines from the Orre region.\pYou understand I can't just let you\npass, right?\pIf it's a fight you want, you've got\none.

#org @gText_CalicinBay_TeamPlutoYolena_Defeat
Nyehehe[.] Just as I expected.

[BLACK]Ena: [RED]Well, Clancy said a lot of what\nI was going to say. He tends to do\lthat.\pSo, instead, let me give you a tip.\pTeam Pluto's HQ is hidden away below\nDaimyn City.\pThere's a secret stairwell in one of\nthe houses on the south end.\pIt's guarded by some sketchy looking\nguys. You'll know when you see\lthem.\pAnd[.] If anyone from HQ asks about\nus[.]\pPlease, don't tell them anything.\pI know we have no right to ask this\nof you, but please consider it.\pWe really will do our best to go\nclean.\pI'd better get going.
