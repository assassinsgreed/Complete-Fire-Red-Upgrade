I heard there's a really powerful\nPok\emon nearby.\pBut, who cares? It can't swim as fast\nas I can!

#org @gText_SeppireCove_SwimmerValerie_Defeat
Oh! Do you think that Pok\emon is a\nbetter battler than me too?

#org @gText_SeppireCove_SwimmerValerie_Chat
I'm sure it was just a rumour.\pIf there really was a powerful\nPok\emon here, I'm sure someone\lwould've seen it already.

Hehehe[.] I can touch the seafloor\nhere.\pDon't think you'll catch me getting\ndistracted by treading water!

#org @gText_SeppireCove_SwimmerIchabod_Defeat
Guess I'm getting grounded in another\nway!

The beach is nice, isn't it?

Ho! A competitor approaches.\nVery well, you rapscallion[.]\pApproach me, and get thoroughly\ntrounced!

#org @gText_SeppireCove_RuinManiacCarter_Defeat
Oof! Trounced, indeed.

If you've come to confirm whether a\nrare Pok\emon is here, then turn\laway.\pI, Carter, shall find it before\nanyone else.
