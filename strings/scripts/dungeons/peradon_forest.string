Trainer Tips!\pIf a Pok\emon is a significantly lower\nlevel than it's foe, it will earn\lmore experience in battle.\pLikewise, if a Pok\emon is a\nsignificantly higher level, it will\learn less.

Hey, you're a trainer, right? Let's\nbattle!

#org @gText_PeradonForest_PokefanClark_Defeat
That was a lot of fun!

#org @gText_PeradonForest_PokefanClark_Chat
You're a good kid. Let me give you\na tip[.]\pSome Pok\emon in Peradon Forest like\nto trick trainers into picking them\lup.\pWatch out for any Pok\e Balls that\nlook strange and you'll be okay.

I took a trip to the ocean and\ncaught some cool Pok\emon.\pI'll show you in the best way\npossible - a battle!

#org @gText_PeradonForest_CollectorFernando_Defeat
B-but[.] My Pok\emon were cool, right?

#org @gText_PeradonForest_CollectorFernando_Chat
My Raichu is very rare.\pI've only seen it appear in the ocean\noccasionally.

#org @gText_PeradonForest_BugCatcherLyle_Intro
[BLUE]I'm going to thrash you in battle, to\nshow my girlfriend how cool I am.

#org @gText_PeradonForest_BugCatcherLyle_Defeat
Ugh[.] I hope Erica didn't see that.

#org @gText_PeradonForest_BugCatcherLyle_Chat
[BLUE]Meh, it's fine that I lost. It was\njust fun enough battling with\lErica.

#org @gText_PeradonForest_BeautyErica_Intro
[RED]I'm not very good at battling, but\nI'm going to try my best for Lyle.

#org @gText_PeradonForest_BeautyErica_Defeat
Oh no! I let Lyle down.

#org @gText_PeradonForest_BeautyErica_Chat
[RED]My boyfriend is really into Pok\emon\nbattles.\pI wanted to try getting into it too,\nto support him.

#org @gText_PeradonForest_PainterSheena_Intro
Agh, don't distract me!\nI'm trying to paint this pond here.

#org @gText_PeradonForest_PainterSheena_Defeat
I dropped my paint palette[.]\nWhat a mess.

#org @gText_PeradonForest_PainterSheena_Chat
I like to paint to relax, but\nbattles work me up again.

I've been camping with my Pok\emon\nsince it was a baby.\pThere's no way you can beat it!

#org @gText_PeradonForest_CamperRupert_Defeat
What happened? Venusaur is supposed\nto be unbeatable.

#org @gText_PeradonForest_CamperRupert_Chat
Camping with my Pok\emon makes it\neven more fun.

#org @gText_PeradonForest_ScientistSean_Intro
Ehehehe[.] I've formed a perfect\nPok\emon team. See it and weep!

#org @gText_PeradonForest_ScientistSean_Defeat
I'm the one that'll be weeping\ntoday[.]

#org @gText_PeradonForest_ScientistSean_Chat
I need to focus on why I lost, to\nmake my team even better.

#org @gText_PeradonForest_RockerRaphael_Intro
This quiet forest[.] It calls for a\nsoothing lullaby.\pBut, that is not my style. Let's rock!

#org @gText_PeradonForest_RockerRaphael_Defeat
I should have played a lullaby\nafter all.

#org @gText_PeradonForest_RockerRaphael_Chat
My instruments echo throughout the\nforest.\pThe sound is quite inspiring.

#org @gText_PeradonForest_ChanellerRenee_Intro
My soul[.] I have given it to the\nspirits of the forest.

#org @gText_PeradonForest_ChanellerRenee_Defeat
The spirits[.] are displeased with me.

#org @gText_PeradonForest_ChanellerRenee_Chat
I am one with the spirits. They guide\nmy hand.\pOhohoho! Do not pity me. I have\nchosen this.

#org @gText_PeradonForest_BlackbeltBrad_Intro
Hoo ha! My Pok\emon and I are\ntraining so we can uproot a\ltree with our bare hands.

#org @gText_PeradonForest_BlackbeltBrad_Defeat
Enough distractions. We must return\nto our training.

#org @gText_PeradonForest_BlackbeltBrad_Chat
Our goal may seem impossible, but\nthat is what gives us motivation.\pWe WILL uproot these trees. Just you\nwatch.

#org @gText_PeradonForest_RuinManiacAlex_Intro
I'm following a rumour that\nexceptional Pok\emon roost nearby.\pYou! I won't let you make that\ndiscovery before me!\pWe battle, now!

#org @gText_PeradonForest_RuinManiacAlex_Defeat
Bah, I don't have time for this.

#org @gText_PeradonForest_RuinManiacAlex_Chat
Those exceptional Pok\emon[.] Could\nthey truly exist?\pI will go to Lake Laplaz and find\nthem before anyone else[.]
