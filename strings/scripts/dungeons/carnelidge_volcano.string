The mountain air soothes the sting\nof this loss, too!

#org @gText_CarnelidgeVolcano_HikerBjorn_Chat
Mountain air is the best[.]\nSo fresh and clean[.]

Ehehehe[.] An ill omen hangs over you,\nchild.

#org @gText_CarnelidgeVolcano_ChannelerKelsey_Defeat
Perhaps you are in control of the\nspirit after all?

#org @gText_CarnelidgeVolcano_ChannelerKelsey_Chat
Take care, lest you fall victim to\ndangerous spirits[.]

Hmm! A curious trainer approaches.\nWe simply must battle!

#org @gText_CarnelidgeVolcano_JugglerSeth_Defeat
Most curious indeed[.]

#org @gText_CarnelidgeVolcano_JugglerSeth_Chat
It's rare to see a gym challenge\nhere, given that there are no gyms\lnearby.\pYou are quite curious, indeed.

My dragons have honed their skills in\nthis very volcano.

#org @gText_CarnelidgeVolcano_DragonTamerFlynn_Defeat
You have honed your skills as well!

True dragons are unbothered by the\nheat of Carnelidge Volcano.

Aw, phooey!

What do we have here? A trainer,\nworn down by Carnelidge's heat?

#org @gText_CarnelidgeVolcano_CrushGirlEunice_Defeat
This heat will not break us!

If you've come here seeking the rare\nSun Pok\emon, then prepare to leave\ldisappointed!

#org @gText_CarnelidgeVolcano_SuperNerdNathan_Defeat
How disappointing!

#org @gText_CarnelidgeVolcano_SuperNerdNathan_Chat
They say the Sun Pok\emon roosts\nhere, but I haven't seen it.\pIs it really possible that Volcarona\nexists? I wonder[.]

You're disrupting my research.\nHow rude. You must be punished.

Perhaps you could help me, actually.

#org @gText_CarnelidgeVolcano_ScientistXander_Chat
I'm studying the activity of\nCarnelidge Volcano.\pIt appears to have increased in\nrecent times.\pI wonder why[.]

Trainer Tips!\pFire Pok\emon are capable of ferrying\ntrainers across pools of lava.\pThis may allow trainers to reach new\nplaces or find new shortcuts.

Rest in the Carnelidge Hot Springs!\nGuaranteed to cure what ails you.
