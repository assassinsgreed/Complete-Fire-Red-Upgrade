A good battle, indeed!

#org @gText_VictoryRoad_CoolTrainerKelly_Chat
I love training here.\pOnly the finest trainers come here,\nso my Pok\emon grow very quickly.

#org @gText_VictoryRoad_CoolTrainerLydia_Intro
Are you surprised to find yourself\noutside of the caves?

#org @gText_VictoryRoad_CoolTrainerLydia_Defeat
Not surprised enough, apparently!

#org @gText_VictoryRoad_CoolTrainerLydia_Chat
Victory Road is made up of caves and\nthe mountain's surface.\pIt's very unusual compared to most\nregions.

#org @gText_VictoryRoad_CoolTrainerRobin_Intro
I don't mean to brag, but I earned\nall my badges within a month.\pYeah, I'm something of a genius.

#org @gText_VictoryRoad_CoolTrainerDahlia_Intro
If you can beat me, I'll let you in\non a little secret.\pToo bad you won't though!

#org @gText_VictoryRoad_CoolTrainerDahlia_Defeat
A deal's a deal.\nI ain't a sore loser.

#org @gText_VictoryRoad_CoolTrainerDahlia_Chat
I saw a rare Pok\emon here.\pIt's strange[.] I don't recall seeing it\nanywhere else in Victory Road.

There you go! Right as rain.\pKeep pushing your limits and strive\nfor the peak. I believe in you!

#org @gText_VictoryRoad_PuzzleTipsSign
A tip to wise trainers: Victory\nRoad is a labrynth of passages.\pBy pushing boulders onto designated\nswitches, you may open shortcuts.\pUse these as needed to recuperate\nas needed, and strive for the peak!\p- Elite Four Committee
