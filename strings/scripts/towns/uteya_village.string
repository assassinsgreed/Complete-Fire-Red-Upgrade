Oh, are you a trainer?\nWe don't get many of those here.\pWelcome to Uteya Village! This is\nthe last stop for gym challengers.

Dennis and Dee are so cool[.]\nI love watching them battle!\pIt's like they're psychic and always\nknow what the other is thinking.

The ruins to the north generate weird\npsychic waves.\pSome Pok\emon seem to really enjoy it\nand are drawn to it.\pMe, though? I think it's really\ncreepy!

The Trainer House here specializes in\na unique battle style popularized\lin Borrius.\pI hear Pok\emon will temporarily\ndevolve during battle.\pHohohoho! I wish it could apply to\nhumans and be permanent!

They say some unusual orbs were\nspotted in the Uteyan Ruins.\pThat would've gotten me fired up\nwhen I was a trainer in my youth.\pThose days are behind me, now.

#org @gText_UteyaVillage_PokemonCenter_SuperNerd
There are a lot of rare Pok\emon that\nlive around here.\pIt's because few people live nearby.

Did you fly here? No?\nWhere are you from?\pWow, Anthra Town?\nThat's far away from here!

I'm about to challenge the gym.\pI'm really not used to the double\nbattles they hold there[.]\pI'll need to think about which items\nwill help secure a victory.

It's so convenient that Pok\eMarts sell\nboth healing items and medicines.

Greetings!\pI am an exceptional move tutor\nspecializing in exceptional moves.\pI can teach your Pok\emon these\nexceptional moves for 10 Pok\eChips.\pAre you interested?\n[BLACK](Held: [BUFFER1])

#org @gText_UteyaVillage_MoveTutor_ConfirmationAccepted
Wonderful! Which of these\nexceptional moves should I teach?

#org @gText_UteyaVillage_MoveTutor_Complete
Done and done.\pYour Pok\emon has learned the move\nexceptionally well!\pDo return if you wish to teach your\nPok\emon more exceptional moves.

#org @gText_UteyaVillage_MoveTutor_Rejected
Unfortunate, but understandable.\pThese exceptional moves require an\nexceptional Pok\emon to learn them.\pCome see me again, if you seek my\ntutelage.

#org @gText_UteyaVillage_MoveTutor_NotEnoughPokeChips
Oh dear[.] You don't have enough\nPok\eChips.\pThese moves are too exceptional to\nteach as a charity.\pPlease return once you have at least\n10 Pok\eChips.

#org @gText_UteyaVillage_SlowpokeNews_Editor_PokemonNotShown
Wh-what are we going to do if we\ncan't report on [BUFFER1]?\pWe could report on the rising\nPok\eMart prices[.]\pNo way! People don't want to read\nabout that!
